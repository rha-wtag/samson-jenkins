# frozen_string_literal: true

# Allows fanning out a stream to multiple listening threads. Each thread will
# have to call `#each`, and will receive each chunk of data that is written
# to the buffer. If a thread starts listening after the buffer has been written
# to, it will receive the previous chunks immediately and then start streaming
# new chunks.
#
# Example:
#
#   buffer = OutputBuffer.new
#
#   listener1 = Thread.new { c = ""; buffer.each {|event, data| c << data }; c }
#   listener2 = Thread.new { c = ""; buffer.each {|event, data| c << data }; c }
#
#   buffer.write("hello ")
#   buffer.write("world!")
#   buffer.close
#
#   listener1.value #=> "hello world!"
#   listener2.value #=> "hello world!"
#
